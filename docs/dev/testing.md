# Testing

pdfly uses [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for testing.

To run the tests you need to install the CI (Continuous Integration) requirements by running: 

```bash
pip install --group '<PATH-TO-ROOT-DIR>/pyproject.toml:ci'

# if 'pyproject.toml' is in the current directory:
pip install --group ci
```
